## Node Management and Control System

Create a system that allows for the control and management of each node in a cluster. The system could use tools like SLURMâ€™s ```scontrol``` to interact with the nodes.

### Project Details:

- Resource Management: The system could provide detailed information about resource usage by each node, including CPU, GPU and memory.
- Monitoring and Alerts: The system could monitor the status and resource usage of each node and send alerts in case of issues.
- Reporting: The system could generate regular reports on the status and resource usage of each node.
- Create an Interface with Dash:
  - Use Dash to create a web interface that allows the user to select a node from the list of available nodes.
  - Use a callback function to automatically update the information about the selected node.
